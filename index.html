              <h2>Profile</h2>
              <p>Hi, all. My name is Charlessia Robinson. I am a recent graduate of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock for the Spring of 2021. 
              I graduated with degrees in Information and Computer Science. My studies at UALR ranged from core computer programming concepts, web development to database design and analysis. 
              Within this time, I gained knowledge and exposure to various software methodologies and applications. Therefore, I believe that I am capable of demonstrating strong analytical, technical and communication skills in business and technology. 
              I am seeking opportunity in technical roles for software and database development. My interests and skills include HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Java, to Python and R for data analysis and visualization. </p>

            <p>Dear employer, </p>
            <p>
                I am pleased to have come across this job opening for the company. I believe that my education and skills 
                make me a qualified candidate for the position. The job description and responsibilities needed match my career interests.

            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my time in school, my coursework ranged from business to computer science and information technology. I gained an understanding 
                about object-oriented programming fundamentals, data structures and algorithms to technical communication and ethics in the IT profession. 
                I have worked with various programming languages such as Python, Java and R including multiple integrated development environments like IDLE, NetBeans, Visual Studios and RStudio.
                I am also familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases including database management systems like Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB and SQLite.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this, I have built up a collection of projects and work that I have completed. Enclosed, I have provided my portfolio along with my resume attached. 
                My portfolio showcases my skills in front-end to back-end web development. Also, my ability to manage projects. Then, measure and report the results from implementing the system or application. 
                My desired area of specialization is in data design, development, analysis, and visualization. Therefore, I am prepared to work through all aspects of the software development lifecycle. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Building a great team and meaningful technological solutions are necessary to support the values of the company, its clients, and the community. I would love to kickstart my career 
                in a company such as yours that shares these similar objectives for success. I would be elated to speak with you about possible employment. After reviewing my application, please 
                feel free to contact me by phone or via email if any additional information is needed. Thank you for your time and consideration.
