<h1>Writing on the Web Semester Reflection</h1><hr>
<h3>a) Thinking Rhetorically about Writing on the Web:</h3>
<p>
	The two most important and meaningful isssues that I learned from my classmate's blog entries this semester relates to the how and the what for communicating on the web. First, I will mention the how. As a person who has always enjoyed design and structure, this is where I was the most intrigued with. I could spend all day looking at web design templates and the way each of them convey a particular message such as this is a blog, newssite or an online store. The design and structure of a site can reflect whether its professional, personal or both. People who visit your site to find content, a product or service, they will consider if this is a trustworthy site to engage with. If the user is having a difficult time finding and reading information, then, this will reflect poorly on the blogger or business. In Pretty as Pie, Cooking Blog Designs, Micah shows how color, font and pictures are necessary for presentation. She mentioned how readers tend to notice if its worth their time based off of design. The visual representation of food is the main attraction for users. The other issue concerns the what which is what the website is for. There must be a reason for your website. It is important to identify the content that you want users to look at. As mentioned in Weinshenk, entry 41, people filter information. It is important to have critical information available for them as soon as possible. If you want them to click a blog post, sign up for on your email list or book you for a consultation, then that needs to be accessible on your landing page. From what I have learn this semester, find key points that you want to communicate with your audience.
</p>
<h3>b) Revision Process:</h3>
<p>
	The revision process has always played a major role throughout my time in school. This course was interesting because there was an added layer to it. For most of my classes the last few semesters, it has primarily focused on me revising my coding for various projects. With coding assignments, you do not have to think about revision as much because if there are errors in your work, then it will be quite noticeable for you to see. For instance, when you run a program, if you have buggy code, your developer platform will catch them and prevent your code from working. However, for this semester, I not only had to critique my coding skills, but also, my writing abilities. I have not had too many writing classes outside of my core requirements. So, this was interesting and quite refreshing to think rhetorically about how we should communicate with technology. I have learned the significance of identifying and understanding the type of audience that I want to share my site with. As I have been accustomed to the software application development process for just code, I can now consider the effects of the Rhetoric Triangle on the content. I have also changed the way that I work through big assignments by working in increments and completing each task.
</p>
<h3>c) Classmate Support:</h3>
<p>
	I have appreciated the emphasis on classroom support from this course. Coding can be quite isolating making it difficult to do group collaborations. However, I cannot say that with the groups that I was participating with. I received a great amount of feedback from the class especially grad students with blog entries and discussion posts. I definitely tried to assist my classmates with learning this semester in particular through the coding assignments. There were grad students who were concerned about their coding skills for the group projects. So, I enjoyed giving them advice and examples to look off of. I felt great being able to help others with coding and different developer tools to use because I know from experiencing how overwhelming this is for beginners like I once was. Although, this is an online class and we are living in the middle of a pandemic that did not stop others from finding time to help me with my work. I came in slightly intimidated about my writing. I did not think that it was going to be good enough, but the grad students were amazing with providing constructive criticism. Learning how to code you really have to be self-disciplined and personal interest to learn and grow as a web developer. I for sure felt the encouragement and interest in my level of knowledge in coding. 
</p>
<h3>d) Challenges:</h3>
<p>
	At the beginning of this course, I came in quite confident in some areas and stressed out about a few other areas. There were some unexpected challenges that surprise me such as the coding assignments. No, they were not difficult to do, but it definitely showed me that I still need to learn some things and keep practicing. I thought Codeacademy was going to be a breeze, but going through the lessons made me realize that there is always room to refresh my mind. I thought that I knew everything about HTML and CSS, but I was gladly mistaken. I never heard of HTML hr tag until now. As a person who is scattered brain, it takes me time to get my thoughts together. Like for this assignment, I started with the code since I am more familiar and comfortable with building websites. Then, I would work on the content for the site. I knew that would be a struggle for me. So, I would try to combat the procrastination by coding first. I also struggled with giving feedback and comments. I wanted to make sure that I gave a substantial amount of advice and support. I spent alot of time trying to make sure my support for others was meaningful and constructive. I also spent alot of time considering the type of blog entries that would be the most impactful to the class. Overall, I thought that it was going to be hard for me to keep pace in this class looking at the schedule, but eventually, I was able to find a routine that would balance the workload of my other classes.   
</p>
<h3>e) Growth & Goals:</h3>
<p>
	Reflecting back over the semester, I definitely set goals for myself to meet all of the expectations required from this course. I wanted to learn more about technical communication and how to effectively do this through blogging which I was able to meet. From reading the class blog and discussions, I gained alot of insight into how we view technology as a tool for communicating. I believe that I made much progress about understanding how pathos, logos and ethos effects people on the web. As a millenial, I always have felt like I was missing out connecting with people online. One of my favorite blog entries was about identifying who you are online such as the image and the audience that you desire to attract. This class has been quite useful in helping me build my portfolio for my Capstone Project. I have used my two blog entries as two writing examples. I really enjoyed re-creating the websites given. I plan to continue sharpening my skills in web design and development. I hope to land a job after I graduate this Spring as a software developer. I would also like to build websites as a business on the side.
