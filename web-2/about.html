<p class="border-box">
	I am Charlessia Robinson. I am from Little Rock, Arkansas, born and raised. I am majoring in Information and Computer Science. I am interested in becoming a software 
	engineer or a data engineer. I am taking this course as part of my electives. I recently this summer started a blog. It has been something that I have always been inspired to want to do, but never took time to do it. I can say from my current experience of creating a blog. There are a lot of steps that go into it such as designing the site with a theme to finding a niche. I thought it was going to be simpler since I have taken technical classes, but it turns out I was wrong. It takes a lot to customize the site and write content that people would like to read. I was definitely overwhelmed with the entire process. When it came to writing blog posts, I did not know where to start. I hope this class can give me a boost of confidence and insight into curating my blog.

	I would recommend Raw Sugar Products from Target. They work amazing. They keep my skin and lips hydrated for a long-time. At this point in my life right now, a perfect day would be me being able to do nothing. I also would just sit outside all day if its a really nice day. I have been quite busy with school from taking summer classes to turning back around for the Fall. It has been definitely stressful trying to balance school and work on personal and professional projects. Therefore, I am looking forward to in the near future is graduating. I will be so happy to get finished with everything. I am the most grateful for my family, health, values and just life itself. My favorite quote is when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade. I think this is important when you have to make the best out of what you have and it turns out to be spectacular. If I had a superpower it would be having the ability to heal, I recently watched a movie on Netflix where the girl was able to bring plants and humans back to life. I tried intermittent fasting this Summer. This Fall I will try my best to stay focused on my health as well as school. As I always I usually make a list of what I need to stick to such as drinking water, getting enough sleep and relaxing!
